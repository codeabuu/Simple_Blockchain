**SIMPLE BLOCKCHAIN**

This is a basic implementation of a blockchain in Python, along with a Flask web application for interacting with the blockchain. This simple blockchain allows you to create transactions, mine new blocks, and maintain a decentralized ledger. Below, you'll find an overview of the combined code and how to use it.

Code Overview

The code consists of two main components:
#Blockchain (blockchain.py)
The blockchain.py file contains the core logic for the blockchain:

>Initialization (__init__): Upon initialization, an empty blockchain (self.chain) and an empty list for pending transactions (self.nowtransaction) are created. Additionally, a genesis block is generated by calling the new_block method.
>Creating a New Block (new_block): This method is used to create a new block in the blockchain. It takes previous_hash and proof as parameters and constructs a block with an index, timestamp, transactions, proof of work, and a reference to the previous block's hash. The block is then added to the blockchain.
>Creating a New Transaction (new_transaction): This method allows you to create a new transaction and add it to the pending transactions list. The transaction includes the sender's address, receiver's address, and the transaction amount.
>Hashing a Block (hash): The hash method takes a block as input, serializes it, and computes its SHA-256 hash. This hash is used to uniquely identify each block.
>Getting the Last Block (last_block): This method returns the last block in the blockchain, which is useful for various operations, including creating new transactions.
>Proof of Work (proof_of_work and valid_proof): The proof_of_work method is used to find a valid proof for a new block. It starts with a proof of 0 and increments it until a valid proof is found. The valid_proof method checks if a proof meets certain criteria (e.g., starts with four leading zeros).

Flask Web Application (BC_Api.py)

The BC_Api.py file contains a Flask web application that provides a RESTful API for interacting with the blockchain:
>Initialization: The Flask app is created, and a unique node ID (node_id) is generated to represent this blockchain node.
>Creating a Blockchain Instance: An instance of the Blockchain class is created, allowing the web application to interact with the blockchain.
>Mining a New Block (/mine route): This route allows users to mine a new block. It retrieves the last block from the blockchain, calculates a new proof of work, creates a new transaction to reward the miner, and adds the new block to the blockchain. The route returns information about the newly mined block in JSON format.
>Creating a New Transaction (/transactions/new route): This route accepts POST requests to create new transactions. Users can send JSON data with sender, receiver, and amount fields to create a transaction. If the required fields are provided, the transaction is added to the pending transactions list, and a response indicates that the transaction will be added to a block.
>Retrieving the Full Blockchain (/chain route): This route allows users to retrieve the current state of the blockchain, including the full chain and its length. The information is returned in JSON format.

Usage

To use this simple blockchain and its web application:
1.clone the repository to your terminal
2.Make all files executable(chmod +x *.py)
3.Start the Flask web application by running BC_Api.py.
root@c9c3062e6abc:~/Simple_Blockchain# python3 BC_Api.py
 * Serving Flask app 'BC_Api'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://<yourip>:5000
 * Running on http://<yourip>:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit

4.Use HTTP requests to interact with the blockchain through the provided routes (/mine, /transactions/new, and /chain) using a tool like curl or a web-based client like Postman.(i prefer curl)i.e
TO use mine on curl run this command: curl -X GET http://<yourip>:5000/mine
